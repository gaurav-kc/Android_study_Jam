/* In kotlin, a variable can be declared in 2 ways 
 * var is like general variable and it's known as a mutable variable in kotlin and can be assigned multiple times.
 * val is like Final variable and it's known as immutable in kotlin and can be initialized only single time.
 * Here we will learn to declare an immutable variable

fun main()
{
    // create an immutable integer variable b as 
    // val b: Int			and run
    
    // b is declared but not assigned any value. Assign 25 as
    // b = 25  and run
    
    // try reassigning a value to b. Type b = 35 below and run
    
    // remove the above statement b = 35 as it has errors.
    // Kotlin can also infer datatype directly if initialized
    // declare variable c as 
    // val c = 25    		and run
    
    // print value of variable using print function print(c)
